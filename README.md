# marketplace_ethersjs
This is a project From Dapp University that I converted from web3 to ethersjs.
soon I will add documentation on it for now you can analyze the code for your learning.


1. Go to project directory and type this command to install ethersjs:
  `npm install ethers`
  
2. import the ethersjs in both the App.js and Main.js files
